# Git <i class="fa fa-github"></i>

Git is a tool that enables you to track changes to files.
It is called a **version control system**. You can change a file
back to a previous version, restore deleted files, and even track down
when a particular line was added to a file (and by who!).

Coders use Git extensively.  There are many open-source
programs online at [Github](https://github.com/) or
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Git makes it possible to
[collaborate](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
with other coders. This makes coding a lot more social than you might think!
