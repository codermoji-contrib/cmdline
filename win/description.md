# Windows Command Prompt <i class="fa fa-windows"></i>

Command Prompt, also known as `cmd.exe` or `cmd` (after its executable file name),
is the command-line interpreter on Windows NT, Windows CE, OS/2 and eComStation
operating systems. It is analogous to the Unix shells used on Unix-like
systems. The initial version of Command Prompt for Windows NT was developed by
Therese Stowell.
