# The Command-line

Other names include _terminal_, _shell_, and _console_. The command line
is the foundation of working with code. You can run your programs on the
command line, and see the results.  You can also
modify files and folders much, much faster on the command line than in
a graphical window. The lessons here will help you to memorise all the
commands you need to work efficiently.
