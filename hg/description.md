# Mercurial

Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed revision control tool for software
developers. It is mainly implemented using the Python programming language, but
includes a binary diff implementation written in C. It is supported on MS
Windows and Unix-like systems, such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Linux.

Mercurial is primarily a command line program but graphical user interface
extensions are available. All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as
arguments to its driver program hg, a reference to the chemical symbol of the
element mercury.
